Bugs:

Jumping in place doesn't change the sprite
Player is not attached to the platforms when they move, as in the platform slides under the player without them moving with it.

Changes:

Implement a proper deathplane rather than checking if the player is -1 on y-axis
Add checkpoints
Disable 2D stuff for now
